# OVPN_exterminator
Automatically delete specified file extension from specified folder

This script does not check if you are still connected to a VPN, it only clears your specified folder (by default /home/kali/Downloads) by removing all .ovpn files by default.
It is possible to change the script to remove other extensions by adjusting the value to a other (example .txt)
